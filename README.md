# hologram_analysis
first ever git repo - analysis script (originally in matlab) designed to take a holographic microscopy time-lapse image and calculate the dry mass over time of each single cell


This is the first attempt at writing an analysis script for my microscopy (holographic) data set.
This script pulls pixel values from a holographic image, segments this data as to belonging to a particular (biological) cell in the image and calculates the summed pixel intensity of that cell, this value corresponding to a measure of individual-cell dry-mass

This was originally attempted in matlab, this can be found in the matlab directory under the root 
Currently migrating over to python
